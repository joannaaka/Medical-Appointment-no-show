### How does certain characteristics of the patient contribute to whether or not the patient show up for the medical appointment?.

* What age group of patients "no show" for appointment.

* Based on the illness of the patients (Alcohlism, Diabetes, Hypertension,Handicap), what type of patients will not show up.

## Insights 
This analysis investigated the medical appointment no-show dataset for hospitals in Brazil.The dataset consists of 110527 patients, with about 20% not showing up for the appointment. The aim of this analysis was to explore variables of the dataset to provide insights as to why patients don't show up for their appointment.Based on this analysis, Waiting duration displayed a positive relationship with the no show rate. As the waiting duration increased the 'no show up rate' increased. According to the Age group, 'Young Adults' had the highest 'no show up rate' and this group displayed gender disparity. Patients who either received scholarship or one or more SMS message showed lower 'no show up rate' as compared to patients who did not receive Scholarship or SMS message. Based on the illness, patients who have hypertension display higer 'no show up rate' compared with other illness. The Neighbourhood was explored and this showed a relationship with the 'no show up rate' and the waiting duration.
